    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat the Grill or Stovetop:</strong> If you're using a grill,
        preheat it to medium-high heat. If you're cooking on the stovetop, heat
        a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shape the Burger Patties:</strong> Divide the ground beef into 4
        equal portions. Gently form each portion into a patty, making sure not
        to overwork the meat. Season both sides of the patties with salt and
        black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the Burger Patties:</strong> <br /><em
          >If you're grilling:</em
        >
        Place the burger patties on the preheated grill. Cook for about 4-5
        minutes per side for medium-rare, or longer to your desired level of
        doneness. During the last minute of cooking, add a slice of cheese to
        each patty and cover the grill to melt the cheese. <br /><em
          >If you're using a stovetop skillet:</em
        >
        Heat a bit of oil in the skillet. Cook the burger patties for about 4-5
        minutes per side, adding the cheese during the last minute and covering
        the skillet to melt it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Toast the Burger Buns:</strong> While the patties are cooking,
        split the hamburger buns and lightly toast the cut sides in a dry
        skillet or on the grill until they are golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the Burgers:</strong> Once the burger patties are
        cooked and the cheese is melted, it's time to assemble your burgers.
        <br />Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of each toasted bun.
        <br />Add a burger patty with melted cheese on top of the lettuce.
        <br />Layer with tomato slices, onion slices, and pickles. <br />Add
        ketchup and mustard or your preferred condiments. <br />If you're adding
        any extra toppings, like bacon or avocado, place them on now.
        <br />Finish with the top half of the toasted bun.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Your homemade hamburgers are ready to
        be enjoyed! Serve them with your favorite side dishes, such as french
        fries, coleslaw, or a simple salad.
      </li>
      <p>
        Customize your hamburgers with your preferred toppings, and savor the
        delicious combination of flavors and textures in this classic comfort
        food.
