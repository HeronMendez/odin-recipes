    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Marinating the Carne Asada</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl, combine the minced garlic, fresh orange juice, fresh lime
        juice, fresh lemon juice, chopped cilantro, vegetable oil, ground cumin,
        chili powder, paprika, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to create the
        marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the flank steak or skirt steak in a large zip-top bag or a shallow
        dish. Pour the marinade over the meat, making sure it's well coated.
        Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or
        overnight for maximum flavor.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Grilling the Carne Asada</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. You can also use a stovetop
        grill pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the marinated steak from the refrigerator and let it sit at room
        temperature for about 30 minutes before grilling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill the steak for about 4-6 minutes per side, or until it reaches your
        preferred level of doneness. Flank steak is typically served medium-rare
        to medium for the best tenderness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the steak is done, transfer it to a cutting board, cover it loosely
        with foil, and let it rest for 5-10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>After resting, thinly slice the carne asada against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assembling the Tacos</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the corn tortillas on the grill or in a dry skillet for a minute or
        two on each side until warm and pliable.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble each taco, place a few slices of carne asada on a warm
        tortilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with sliced avocado or guacamole, chopped cilantro, diced onion, and
        your choice of salsa.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the carne asada tacos with lime wedges on the side for squeezing
        over the top.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Enjoy your homemade carne asada tacos, filled with tender, flavorful beef
      and fresh, zesty toppings. These tacos are perfect for a family dinner or
      a fun taco night with friends.
