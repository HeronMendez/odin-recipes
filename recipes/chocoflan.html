        <h1>Chocoflan</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Chocoflan, also known as "pastel imposible" or "impossible cake,"
          features a layer of creamy caramel flan on the bottom and a moist
          chocolate cake on top. When baked, the two layers magically switch
          places, creating a beautiful dessert with contrasting flavors and
          textures.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the Caramel</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the flan layer</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the chocolate cake layer</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). You'll need a Bundt pan for this
        recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start by making the caramel layer: In a small saucepan, combine the
        sugar and water. Heat over medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally,
        until the sugar melts and turns a deep amber color. Be careful not to
        burn it. Immediately pour the caramel into the bottom of your Bundt pan
        and swirl it around to coat the bottom evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, prepare the flan layer: In a blender, combine the sweetened
        condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, and vanilla extract. Blend until
        smooth. Gently pour this mixture over the caramel layer in the Bundt
        pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the cake layer, in a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour,
        cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the
        vegetable oil, eggs, vanilla extract, and buttermilk. Mix until the
        batter is smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully pour the chocolate cake batter over the flan layer in the
        Bundt pan, ensuring you do so gently to prevent the layers from mixing
        too much.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the Bundt pan with aluminum foil and place it inside a larger,
        ovenproof dish. Add hot water to the larger dish until it reaches
        halfway up the side of the Bundt pan, creating a water bath.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 30 minutes or until a
        toothpick inserted into the chocolate cake layer comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the chocoflan from the oven and let it cool in the water bath for
        about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cooled, carefully invert the chocoflan onto a serving platter. The
        caramel and flan layers will be on top, and the chocolate cake layer on
        the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chill the chocoflan in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or until
        serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To serve, slice the chocoflan and enjoy the <em>creamy</em>,
      caramel-infused flan paired with the moist chocolate cake. It's a
      delightful dessert that's sure to impress your guests!
