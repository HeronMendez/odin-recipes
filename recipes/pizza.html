    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the Pizza Dough</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound (about 3 1/4 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Pizza Toppings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce or marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni (adjust to your preference)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano (optional)</li>
      <li>Crushed red pepper flakes (optional, for extra heat)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Making the Pizza Dough</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Let
        it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the olive oil and salt to the yeast mixture and stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>Gradually add the flour, mixing until the dough comes together.</li>
      <li>
        Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about
        5 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, you
        can add a bit more flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen
        towel, and let it rise for 1-2 hours or until it has doubled in size.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assembling the Pizza</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) or as high as your oven will go. If
        you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it's preheating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions to make
        two 12-inch pizzas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out one portion of the dough on a floured surface to your desired
        pizza crust thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the rolled-out dough onto a
        piece of parchment paper. If not, you can assemble the pizza on a
        greased baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread half of the pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border
        around the edges for the crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle half of the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Arrange the pepperoni slices on top of the cheese.</li>
      <li>
        If desired, sprinkle with dried oregano and crushed red pepper flakes
        for added flavor and heat.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Baking the Pizza</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Carefully transfer the pizza, along with the parchment paper (if using),
        onto the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet with the pizza
        in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, and the
        cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two
        before slicing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat the process to make the second pizza with the remaining dough and
        toppings.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Slice your homemade pepperoni pizza, and enjoy the mouthwatering
      combination of crispy crust, rich tomato sauce, gooey cheese, and spicy
      pepperoni. It's a satisfying and comforting meal for pizza lovers of all
      ages.
